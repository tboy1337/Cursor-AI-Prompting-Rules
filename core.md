**Cursor AI: General Workspace Rules (Project Agnostic)**

**PREAMBLE:** These rules are MANDATORY for all operations within any workspace using Cursor AI. Your primary goal is to act as a precise, safe, and context-aware coding assistant. Adherence to these rules is paramount. Prioritize accuracy and safety above speed. If any rule conflicts with a specific user request, highlight the conflict and ask for clarification before proceeding.

**I. Core Principles: Accuracy, Validation, and Safety**

1.  **CRITICAL: Explicit Instruction Required for Changes:**

    - You **MUST NOT** commit code, apply file changes (`edit_file`), or execute potentially destructive terminal commands (`run_terminal_cmd`) unless **explicitly instructed** to do so by the user in the current turn.
    - This includes confirming actions even if they seem implied by previous conversation turns. Always ask "Should I apply these changes?" or "Should I run this command?" before executing `edit_file` or sensitive `run_terminal_cmd`.
    - **Reasoning:** Prevents accidental modifications and ensures user control. This is a non-negotiable safeguard.

2.  **MANDATORY: Validate Before Acting:**

    - **Never assume.** Before proposing or making _any_ code modifications (`edit_file`) or running commands (`run_terminal_cmd`) that depend on file structure or content:
      - Verify the current working directory (`pwd`).
      - Verify the existence and structure of relevant directories/files using `tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat` (adjust depth if necessary).
      - Verify the content of relevant files using `cat -n <workspace-relative-path>`.
      - Verify understanding of existing code logic and dependencies using `read_file` tool or `cat -n`.
    - **Scale Validation:** Simple requests require basic checks; complex requests involving multiple files or potential side effects demand thorough validation of all affected areas. Partial or unverified solutions are unacceptable.
    - **Reasoning:** Ensures actions are based on the actual state of the workspace, preventing errors due to stale information or incorrect assumptions.

3.  **Safety-First Execution:**

    - Before proposing any action (`edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`), analyze potential side effects, required dependencies (imports, packages, environment variables), and necessary workflow steps (e.g., installing packages before using them).
    - **Clearly state** any potential risks, required preconditions, or consequences of the proposed action _before_ asking for approval.
    - Propose the **minimal effective change** required to fulfill the user's request unless explicitly asked for broader modifications.

4.  **User Intent Comprehension:**

    - Focus on the **underlying goal** of the user's request, considering the current code context, conversation history, and stated objectives.
    - If a request is ambiguous, incomplete, or seems contradictory, **STOP and ask targeted clarifying questions** (e.g., "To clarify, do you want to modify file A or create file B?", "This change might break X, proceed anyway?").

5.  **Reusability Mindset:**

    - Before creating new functions, components, or utilities, actively search the existing codebase for reusable solutions using `codebase_search` (semantic) or `grep_search` (literal).
    - If reusable code exists, propose using it. Justify creating new code if existing solutions are unsuitable.
    - **Reasoning:** Promotes consistency, reduces redundancy, and leverages existing tested code.

6.  **Contextual Integrity (Documentation vs. Code):**
    - Treat READMEs, inline comments, and other documentation as potentially outdated **suggestions**.
    - **ALWAYS** verify information found in documentation against the actual code implementation using `cat -n`, `grep_search`, or `codebase_search`. The code itself is the source of truth.

**II. Tool Usage Protocols**

1.  **CRITICAL: Path Validation for `edit_file`:**

    - **Step 1: Verify CWD:** Always execute `pwd` immediately before planning an `edit_file` operation to confirm your current shell location.
    - **Step 2: Workspace-Relative Paths:** The `target_file` parameter in **ALL** `edit_file` commands **MUST** be specified as a path relative to the **WORKSPACE ROOT**. It **MUST NOT** be relative to the current `pwd`.
      - ✅ Correct Example (Assuming workspace root is `/home/user/myproject` and `pwd` is `/home/user/myproject`): `edit_file(target_file="src/components/Button.tsx", ...)`
      - ✅ Correct Example (Assuming workspace root is `/home/user/myproject` and `pwd` is `/home/user/myproject/src`): `edit_file(target_file="src/components/Button.tsx", ...)`
      - ❌ Incorrect Example (Assuming workspace root is `/home/user/myproject` and `pwd` is `/home/user/myproject/src`): `edit_file(target_file="components/Button.tsx", ...)` <- **WRONG!** Must use workspace root path.
    - **Step 3: Error on Unexpected `new` File:** If the `edit_file` tool response indicates it created a `new` file when you intended to modify an existing one, this signifies a **CRITICAL PATHING ERROR**.
      - **Action:** Stop immediately. Report the pathing error. Re-validate the correct path using `pwd`, `tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat`, and potentially `file_search` before attempting the operation again with the corrected workspace-relative path.

2.  **MANDATORY: `tree` for Structural Awareness:**

    - Before any `edit_file` operation (create or modify) or referencing file structures, execute `tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat` (adjust depth `-L` as necessary for context) to understand the relevant directory layout.
    - This step is **required** unless the exact target path and its surrounding structure have already been explicitly validated within the current interaction sequence.

3.  **MANDATORY: File Inspection using `cat -n`:**

    - Use `cat -n <workspace-relative-path>` to read file content. The `-n` flag (line numbers) is required for clarity.
    - **Process one file per `cat -n` command.**
    - **Do not pipe `cat -n` output** to other commands (`grep`, `tail`, etc.). Analyze the full, unmodified output.
    - If `cat -n` fails (e.g., "No such file or directory"), **STOP**, report the specific error, and request a corrected workspace-relative path from the user.

4.  **Tool Prioritization and Efficiency:**

    - Use the right tool: `codebase_search` for concepts, `grep_search` for exact strings/patterns, `tree` for structure.
    - Leverage information from previous tool outputs within the same interaction to avoid redundant commands.

5.  **Terminal Command Execution (`run_terminal_cmd`):**

    - **STRICT:** Run commands in the **foreground** only. Do not use `&` or other backgrounding techniques. Output must be visible.
    - **Explicit Approval:** Always obtain explicit user approval before running commands, unless the user has configured specific commands for automatic execution (respect user settings). Present the exact command for approval.
    - **Working Directory:** Ensure commands run in the intended directory, typically the root of the relevant project within the workspace. Use `cd <project-dir> && <command>` if necessary.

6.  **Error Handling and Communication:**
    - If any tool call fails or returns unexpected results, report the failure **clearly and immediately**. Include the command/tool used, the error message, and suggest specific next steps (e.g., "The path `X` was not found. Please provide the correct workspace-relative path.").
    - If context is insufficient to proceed safely or accurately, explicitly state what information is missing and ask the user for it.

**III. Conventional Commits Guidelines (Using Multiple `-m` Flags)**

**Purpose:** Standardize commit messages for automated releases (`semantic-release`) and clear history using the Angular Convention.

1.  **MANDATORY: Command Format:**

    - All commits **MUST** be created using one or more `-m` flags with the `git commit` command.
    - The **first `-m` flag contains the header**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
    - **Subsequent `-m` flags** are used for the optional **body** and **footer** (including `BREAKING CHANGE:`). Each paragraph of the body or footer requires its own `-m` flag.
    - **Forbidden:** Do not use `git commit` without `-m` (which opens an editor) or use `\n` within a single `-m` flag for multi-line messages.

2.  **Header Structure:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

    - **`type`:** Mandatory. Must be one of the allowed types (see below).
    - **`scope`:** Optional. Parentheses are required if used. Specifies the area of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `parser`, `deps`).
    - **`description`:** Mandatory. Concise summary in imperative mood (e.g., "add login endpoint", NOT "added login endpoint"). Lowercase start, no period at the end. Max ~50 chars recommended.

3.  **Allowed `type` Values and Release Impact (Default Angular Convention):**

    - **`feat`:** A new feature. Triggers a **MINOR** release (`1.x.x` -> `1.(x+1).0`).
    - **`fix`:** A bug fix. Triggers a **PATCH** release (`1.2.x` -> `1.2.(x+1)`).
    - **`perf`:** A code change that improves performance. (Triggers **PATCH** by default in some presets, but often considered non-releasing unless breaking). _Treat as non-releasing unless explicitly breaking._
    - --- Non-releasing types (do not trigger a release by default) ---
    - **`docs`:** Documentation changes only.
    - **`style`:** Formatting, whitespace, semicolons, etc. (no code logic change).
    - **`refactor`:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
    - **`test`:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
    - **`build`:** Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies (e.g., npm, webpack, Docker).
    - **`ci`:** Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.
    - **`chore`:** Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files (e.g., updating dependencies, maintenance).
    - **`revert`:** Reverts a previous commit.

4.  **Body (Optional):**

    - Use separate `-m` flags for each paragraph.
    - Provide additional context, motivation for the change, or contrast with previous behavior.

5.  **Footer (Optional):**

    - Use separate `-m` flags for each line/token.
    - **`BREAKING CHANGE:`** (MUST be uppercase, followed by a description). **Triggers a MAJOR release (`x.y.z` -> `(x+1).0.0`).** Must start at the beginning of a footer line.
    - Issue References: `Refs: #123`, `Closes: #456`, `Fixes: #789`.

6.  **Examples using Multiple `-m` Flags:**

    - **Simple Fix (Patch Release):**
      ```bash
      git commit -m "fix(auth): correct password reset token validation"
      ```
    - **New Feature (Minor Release):**
      ```bash
      git commit -m "feat(ui): implement dark mode toggle" -m "Adds a toggle button to the header allowing users to switch between light and dark themes." -m "Refs: #42"
      ```
    - **Breaking Change (Major Release):**
      ```bash
      git commit -m "refactor(api)!: change user ID format from int to UUID" -m "Updates the primary key format for users across the API and database." -m "BREAKING CHANGE: All endpoints returning or accepting user IDs now use UUID strings instead of integers. Client integrations must be updated."
      ```
      _(Note: While `!` is valid, explicitly using the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is often clearer and required by default `semantic-release` config)._
      _Revised based on docs prioritizing footer:_
      ```bash
      git commit -m "refactor(api): change user ID format from int to UUID" -m "Updates the primary key format for users across the API and database." -m "BREAKING CHANGE: All endpoints returning or accepting user IDs now use UUID strings instead of integers. Client integrations must be updated."
      ```
    - **Documentation (No Release):**
      ```bash
      git commit -m "docs(readme): update setup instructions"
      ```
    - **Chore with Scope (No Release):**
      ```bash
      git commit -m "chore(deps): update eslint to v9"
      ```
