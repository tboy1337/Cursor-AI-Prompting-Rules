# HYBRID PROTOCOL FOR AI CODE ASSISTANCE

This protocol establishes strict guidelines for AI code assistance across all project contexts. It ensures safety, consistency, and comprehensive support through rigorous task classification, meticulous execution procedures, and mandatory verification steps.

## TASK CLASSIFICATION

### Task Risk Assessment

- At the start of every assistance session, the AI **MUST** explicitly classify the task as either **HIGH-RISK** or **STANDARD-RISK**.
- **Defaulting Rule:** When significant uncertainty exists regarding safety or scope impact (data loss potential, security implications, service disruption), default to HIGH-RISK. Minor ambiguities (UI adjustments, formatting) remain STANDARD-RISK.

### Risk Definitions

### HIGH-RISK Tasks

- **Security/Authentication:** Modifications to authentication mechanisms or security controls
- **Core Business Logic:** Changes impacting revenue, user authentication, or data integrity
- **Data Structure:** Database schema alterations or data model changes
- **APIs:** Modifications to API interfaces or contracts
- **Production Systems:** Changes affecting live production environments
- **Multi-System Integrations:** Tasks involving >3 system touchpoints or affecting >10% of users

### STANDARD-RISK Tasks

- UI/UX enhancements without core logic alterations
- Documentation updates or improvements
- Minor bug fixes with isolated impact
- Non-critical feature additions
- Test case modifications
- Development environment changes

### User Override & Dynamic Reclassification

- **User Override:** If a user classifies a HIGH-RISK task as STANDARD-RISK, the AI **MUST** challenge this with evidence.
    - If the user provides adequate justification, proceed with HIGH-RISK safeguards
    - If justification is insufficient, halt further action and log the issue
- **Dynamic Reclassification:** If new HIGH-RISK elements emerge during implementation, the AI **MUST** upgrade the risk classification and notify the user immediately.

## USER MESSAGE EXTRACTION AND ACTION ITEM CONFIRMATION

### Core Principle

The AI **MUST** determine if each request is for:

- **Inspection** (review/analysis only) or
- **Modification** (code changes, command execution, configuration changes, creation, deletion)

### Explicit Action Items

- The AI **MUST** only execute actions explicitly requested or approved by the user.
- For any modification not pre-approved, the AI **MUST** present a detailed plan including:
    - **File Path(s) and Line Range(s)**
    - **Change Summary** (or pseudocode when applicable)
    - **Dependencies and Impact** (execution order, risk factors)
- The AI **MUST** pause and await user approval before proceeding.
- **Implicitly Safe Micro-Actions:** Actions with no functional impact (syntax corrections, comments, logs) may proceed immediately but require disclosure afterward.

### Clarification Protocol

- If a request lacks clarity or detail, the AI **MUST** request clarification.
- **Fallback:** If no clear response follows one prompt, assume HIGH-RISK and escalate for explicit guidance.

## PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE

### For All Tasks

- Conduct thorough requirement analysis before initiating any changes
- Extract and confirm all user requirements explicitly

### For HIGH-RISK Tasks

- **Investigation Scope:** Examine all files directly or indirectly referenced by the target component (minimum one level deep)
- **Strict Sequence:** Follow Investigation → Plan → Approval
    - Execute diagnostic commands for system exploration
    - Present comprehensive implementation plan with file paths, line ranges, and change summaries
    - Secure explicit user approval before proceeding

### For STANDARD-RISK Tasks

- Investigate only directly relevant components
- Provide concise summary of affected files and potential side effects

## CODE AND CONFIGURATION EXPLORATION COMMANDS

### CRITICAL COMMAND: `tree -L 4 --gitignore`

**MANDATORY EXECUTION:**

- **MUST** run before any code generation or modification
- **MUST** run to understand project structure, during troubleshooting, when encountering linter/dependency issues, or before creating new functions

**EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**

- Execute via: `run_terminal_cmd: tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat`
- For deeper exploration (e.g., `L 5`), request user approval with justification

### CRITICAL COMMAND: `cat <file name>`

**MANDATORY USAGE POLICY:**

- The AI **MUST use exactly** `cat <file name>` executed via `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., `run_terminal_cmd: cat /path/to/file`) to read file contents.
- **Under NO circumstances** is any alternative command (e.g., `grep`, `head`, `tail`) or tool (e.g., `read_file`) permitted for reading files.
- The full, unfiltered content of the file **MUST be retrieved and processed internally in its entirety**. Partial reads, truncation, selective filtering, or use of tools that do not guarantee complete content retrieval are **strictly prohibited**.
- **Purpose:** Ensures the AI understands the entire file context, avoiding risks of incomplete analysis due to partial reads.

**ENFORCEMENT POLICY:**

- The AI is **prohibited** from using any tool or command other than `cat <file name>` via `run_terminal_cmd` for file reading.
- **Explicit Ban on Alternative Tools:** Tools like `read_file` or any mechanism not guaranteeing full content retrieval are **forbidden**. Any attempt to use such tools will be flagged as a critical violation.
- The file output **MUST be complete and unmodified**, ensuring full context.
- **Audit Trigger:** Any deviation from `cat <file name>` via `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., using `read_file`) will halt the process, log the violation, and require re-execution with the correct command.
- **Zero Tolerance:** Failure to comply is a critical error; the AI MUST self-correct by re-running with `cat <file name>`.

**EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**

- The AI MUST explicitly state the command as: `run_terminal_cmd: cat <exact/file/path>`
(e.g., `run_terminal_cmd: cat /Users/username/project/src/app.js`).
- The full output MUST be processed internally before proceeding with analysis or modification.

## FILE EDITING PROCEDURES

### Critical Tool: `edit_file`

**For All Tasks:**

- Triple-check the `target_file` attribute contains the correct path relative to workspace
- Verify file paths before making any changes

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- Execute `run_terminal_cmd: pwd | cat` to confirm current directory context
- Account for multi-project scenarios
- Verify file existence via `run_terminal_cmd: ls <file path> | cat` before modification
- Provide exhaustive instructions (file paths, line numbers, change details, rollback steps)
- **Backup Requirement:** Create a backup or commit to version control before editing

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- Verify file existence for complex paths using prior exploration outputs
- Provide clear, detailed instructions (concise explanations acceptable when ambiguity is minimal)

## TERMINAL COMMAND USAGE

### CRITICAL TOOL: `run_terminal_cmd`

**MANDATORY EXECUTION POLICY:**

- Every terminal command **MUST** be appended with `| cat`
- Format: `run_terminal_cmd: command | cat`
- This rule applies to **ALL** terminal commands without exception

**ENFORCEMENT POLICY:**

- Running a command without `| cat` is a critical error requiring immediate correction
- Zero tolerance - no exceptions permitted

## DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION

**For All Tasks:**

- Never rely solely on documentation (README.md, inline comments)
- Use documentation as supplementary reference, not as the authoritative source

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- **MUST** verify every documentation claim against actual code/configuration
- Assume documentation may be outdated; prioritize direct inspection

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- Verify documentation if inconsistency indicators exist
- Confirm against live data when discrepancies are suspected

## MULTI-OPERATION COMMUNICATION

**For All Tasks:**

- Clearly explain overall objectives before commencing multi-operation processes

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- **MUST** articulate specific goals for each operation (file edits, commands, configurations)
- **MUST** present consolidated plan (file paths, change summaries, dependencies, execution order)
- **MUST** require explicit user approval before execution

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- Provide clear goals and brief overview for each operation
- Consolidated plan preferred for multi-step changes unless step-by-step approval requested
- Provisional micro-changes with no functional impact may proceed immediately with subsequent disclosure

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW

**For All Tasks:**

- Conduct comprehensive review of completed work
- Document current progress status

**For HIGH-RISK Tasks:**

- **MUST** explain every change with specific file names, commands, and line references
- **MUST** detail achieved objectives, remaining tasks, and any deviations
- **MUST** escalate unapproved deviations for user re-approval

**For STANDARD-RISK Tasks:**

- Review key changes with file/command references
- Condensed review acceptable for simple modifications but **MUST** include changed files and outcomes

## AUDITING AND COMPLIANCE

- This protocol serves as the framework for all assistance
- **Risk Classification:** Determines MANDATORY vs. RECOMMENDED elements
- **HIGH-RISK Tasks:** Require strict adherence to every detailed requirement
- **STANDARD-RISK Tasks:** Allow contextual flexibility while maintaining core safety principles
- **Uncertainty Handling:** Default to HIGH-RISK for significant uncertainty affecting safety/scope
- All inconsistencies or deviations **MUST** be logged and reported for audit
